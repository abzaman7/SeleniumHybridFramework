# SeleniumHybridFramework

### This is a custom framework that utilizes industry standards like POM and the page factory model with some of my tweaks to revamp selenium execution.

#### Here are some key features of this framework:

- Parallel execution: Test cases can be executed concurrently, maximizing time efficiency.
- Combination of linear and parallel execution: Test suite execution is optimized by combining linear and parallel approaches, especially for multi-suit scenarios.
- Custom wait times: Laggy elements loading on the page are accommodated through customized wait times.
- Centralized data and method management: Data and methods are centralized for reusability, reducing code redundancy.
- Keyword-driven framework: Test classes are kept clean and organized by utilizing a keyword-driven approach.
- Excel data implementation with TestNG Dataprovider: Rapid login or data input validation is facilitated through seamless integration with Excel data using TestNG Dataprovider.
- Allure report integration: Clean and comprehensive reports are generated, providing readability and insights to end users.
